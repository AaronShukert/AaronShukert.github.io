Given two continuous function $f:[0,1] \xrightarrow{} \mathbb{R}$ and $g:[0,1]  \xrightarrow{} \mathbb{R}$, we define the L<sub>2</sub> inner product of _f_ and _g_, denoted by $\langle f,g\rangle$, by the formula

 $\int_{0}^{1} f(x)g(x)dx$. 
 
 We can quickly check that this is an inner product by showing it satisfies the linearity and symmetric properties.
 
 - Linearity
 
 $\langle \alpha f + \beta g, h\rangle = \int_0^1 (\alpha f(x) + \beta g(x)) h(x) dx = \int_0^1\alpha f(x)h(x) + \int_0^1 \beta g(x)h(x)$

$ = \alpha\langle f,h\rangle + \beta\langle g,h \rangle.$

- Symmetry

$\langle f,g\rangle =\int_0^1 f(x)g(x)dx = \int_0^1 g(x)f(x)dx= \langle g,f\rangle$

Now, since we know that this is an inner product, we already know that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequalioty applies, but sometimes it can be enlightening to build a proof in the context with which you are working. So, in this spirit, we aim to prove the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality which (in this context) is stated as follows: 

$\Bigg\| \int_{0}^{1} f(x)g(x)dx \Bigg\| \leq \sqrt{\int_{0}^{1} [f(x)]^2dx}\sqrt{\int_{0}^{1} [g(x)]^2dx}$

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
