As of 2021, I am a Mathematician / Software Engineer looking for difficult and interesting work. I finished my Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Physics at Colorado State University in 2019. From there, I worked as a software engineer, flipped burgers, and dabbled in a few coding projects (including making this website). In 2020 I enrolled as a mathematics PhD. student at Michigan State University and worked as a calculus teacher. Due to the unideal situation brought about by COVID, I've decided to instead pursue a professional career in software, but will perhaps return to academia if the right opportunity arises.

### Interests

My research interests primarily consist of the following:

- [Dynamical Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) and [Ergodic Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory)
- [Complex Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis)
- [Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)
