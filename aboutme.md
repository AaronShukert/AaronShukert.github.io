As of Fall 2020, I am a mathematics PhD student at Michigan State University. I finished my Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Physics at Colorado State University in 2019. During my break from school, I worked as a software engineer and dabbled in a few coding projects (including making this website). 

### Interests

My research interests primarily consist of the following:

- [Dynamical Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) and [Ergodic Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory)
- [Complex Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis)
- [Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)
