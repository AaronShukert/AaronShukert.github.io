I finished my Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics at Colorado State University in 2019. Since then, I have worked as a software engineer and dabbled in a few coding projects (including making this website). I intend to enroll as a mathematics PhD student in the fall of 2020. 


### Interests

My research interests primarily consist of the following:

- [Dynamical Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) and [Ergodic Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory)
- [Complex Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis)
- [Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)
